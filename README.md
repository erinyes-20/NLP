# NLP description

A search engine was built using a vector space model of an information retrieval system. The base VSM was improved for querying the Cranfield dataset by implementing:
- Latent Semantic Indexing - Singular value decomposition was used to find similar context vectors
- BM25 - A better ranking meeasure than vanilla TF-IDF 
- Word2vec - effect of word vectors on optimal encoding
